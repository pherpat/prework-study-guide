## This is a short but useful guide to go throug some coding basics.

In this guide there is a basic information about the different coding tools used to build a website. The examples explained in this guide are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. It was created based on my personal process going through each program. I hope this information can be useful for current or new students. Even though it was challenging, it was rewarding to see the final project. I learned the importance of keeping everything clean and organized for a better  understanding of the process and the final product. Being aware of small details, and the information provided is crucial to execute what I had in mind when I started the project.
