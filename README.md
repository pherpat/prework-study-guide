# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## This is a short but useful guide to go throug some coding basics.

In this guide there is a basic information about the different coding tools used to build a website. The examples explained in this guide are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. It was created based on my personal process going through each program. I hope this information can be useful for current or new students. Even though it was challenging, it was rewarding to see the final project. I learned the importance of keeping everything clean and organized for a better  understanding of the process and the final product. Being aware of small details, and the information provided is crucial to execute what I had in mind when I started the project. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

To successfully install my project I had to create a new reposition using tools like Git that allows me to add, and/or modify information into my local computer to then push it to a remote location and share it with the world in this case Github. It is also possible to create a reposition using GitHub first and the create a connection to my local computer.Once the connection was created I was able to code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through a source code editor called Visual Studio.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
